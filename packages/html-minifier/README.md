# interlock-html-minifier

This will minify any HTML files that are part of your build, relying on @kantax's awesome [html-minifier](https://github.com/kangax/html-minifier#options-quick-reference) for all of the heavy-lifting.  All options passed to the plugin are the same as for that library.  You can find documentation on those options [here](https://github.com/kangax/html-minifier#options-quick-reference).
